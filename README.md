#### _A Website that takes a number and displays a list of 0 to that number back with exceptions, June 8, 2018_

#### By _**Nick Rogers**_

## Description

_This website was created to take a number, and display a range of numbers back with 0s replaced with "Beep!", 1's replaced with "Boop!" and numbers divisible by 3 with "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.".
Specs:
1. Allow only numbers to be entered.
  Example input: "hello"
  Example output: "please enter a number"

2. Take entered number and create an array that holds 0 to that number.
  Example input: 10
  Example output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

3. Display the array in a list on html.
  Example input: [0,1,2,3]
  Example output:   - 0  
                    - 1
                    - 2
                    - 3

4. Create a branch that first checks for numbers divisible by 3, then for numbers containing 1, then for numbers containing 0 that filters numbers as they are pushed into the array and replaces the number with the proper message.
  Example input: [...,9,10,11,12]
  Example output: [...,"Sorry dave...","Boop!","Boop!","Boop!"]
